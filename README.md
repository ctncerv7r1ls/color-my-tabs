This is an extension for Pale Moon web browser which can color your tabs relatively to their favicons basing on dominant color lookup. It has some parameters which can be customized such as fading style, saturation, brightness, opacity, font colors for each tab state and also few other additional tweaks.

### Building
Pack all files (except README.md, update.rdf and build.sh) from this directory into a ZIP archive with .xpi extension. Alternatively, while on Linux, make build.sh an executable via terminal with `chmod +x build.sh` and execute it with `./build.sh`.

### Usage
Open the .xpi file with Pale Moon or drag the .xpi file inside its window and confirm installation. Tabs should become colored. Preferences of the extension are accessible within Add-ons Manager page.
