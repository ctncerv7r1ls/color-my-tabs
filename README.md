This is an extension for Pale Moon web browser which colors your tabs relatively to their favicons. It uses dominant color lookup to this purpose, with some restrictions. It has several parameters which can be customized such as fading style, saturation, brightness, opacity, font colors for each tab state and also few other additional tweaks.

### Theme compatibility
Besides Pale Moon's default theme, it should also work correctly with following custom themes: Aeromoon, Camimoon, Compact Moon, Dark Moon, Darkness, DarkPitch, Fox 2 The Moon, Kempelton Reloaded, LittleMoon, MicroMoon, Modoki Moon, Moonfox3, Moonola, Nauticalia, Noia Moon, Past Modern Revisited, Phoenity Rebirth, Qute 4 PM, Qute Large, Qute Legacy, Reinheit, Tangerinemoon, Tangomoon and White Moon.

### Building
Pack all files (except README.md and build.sh) from this directory into a ZIP archive with .xpi extension. Alternatively, while on Linux, make build.sh an executable via terminal with `chmod +x build.sh` and execute it with `./build.sh` to create the .xpi file.
